# Introduction

Hi and welcome in the Astronomer certification, Apache Airflow Core, preparation course.

My name is Marc Lamberti and I'm happy to see your here, why?

Because by taking that course, you are putting all the odds in your favor in order to succeed the exam.

And that's exactly the goal of the preparation course.

And the en of this course, you will be ready for the exam.

All the topics covered during that course, are directly related to what your gonna see during teh exam.

So again, by being here, you made the right choice.

But let me give you a quick overview of alll the different topics we're gonna see.

The preparation course is divided in four different sections.

The first on is really about the very basics of airflow.

Such as, what are the diferrent use cases fir whic airflow is suitable or not?

- USES CASES
- COMPONENETS
- CORE CONCEPTS
- INSTALLING
- UPDATING

What are the different components such as the web server, the scheduler, the meta database that airflow needs to run.

Then what are the core concepts pf airflow, such as DAGs, task instances, operators.

Then we will see how tos install manually airflow.

You have to know how to do it.

Even if there is a good chance that you will use docker.

And then, how to update it.

Indeed, as you might already know, airflow 2.2 is out.

And so you have to know how to update airflow as definitely don't want to, stay with older vesiosn.

Once we have seen those basics, we will move to htere different aspects that you will interact wich a lot.

Which are, the command line interface, the user interface and the REST API.

Indeed, there are three ways of interacting with apache airflow.

The command line interface if you want to execute some commands.

Like initializing the database of airflow.

The user interface to interact with your DAGs, and the REST API, for example, if you have a front end and you want to interact with your airflow instance, you can do that with the REST API.

So we will go through all of those components.

Then, in the search section, we will dive into DAGs.

And more specifically, what are the minimu requirements in order to instcatiate a DAG?

What are the different basic parameters that you absolutely have to know?

Such as, start date, schedule interval and so on.

Then how to monitor your DAGs from the UI.

Like if a task fails, what should you do?

How to share data between tasks, using XComs.

There are some limitations and you have to be aware of that.

And last bit not least, how to create connections in order to interact with sub party tools.

Finally, the tast section of the preparation course, is about parallelism.

How to execute multiple taks in parallel, with airflow.

And for taht, we will discover, what are the different executors you can use.

The sequential executor, the local executor and the celery executor, if you have multiple machines.

And last but not least, all the different parameters taht you absolutely need to know, such as parallelism, DAG concurrency, and others.

So as you can see the preparation course is pretty intense, but you will learn everything you need, in order to succeed for the exam.

But also, in order to use airflow in the best possible way.

The preparation course is really, hands-on focused.

So I strongly advise you to answer all teh questions along the course.

As well as trying to do exactly what I'm going to show you, on your computer.

I strongly believe in learnig by doing.

So please, try to follow what I'm going to show you on yout computer.

And to do that, there is one prerequisite, which is to install docker, on your computer.

Indeed, we are going to install the astronomer CLI.

And if you don't know what the astronomer CLI is, it is the easiest and fastest way, to set up and run airflow locally.

If for some reasons you are not able to install docker and the astronomer CLI, that's perfectly fine.

Just focus on what you are going to learn during the preparation course, and you will be ready to pass the exam as well.

Now, I wuold like to add some addiotional .

And the first one is, the preparation course is not a race.

This is not a race.

So take your time in aorder to fully understand the different concepts, that you are going to discover.

Or so, if at some point you struggle to understand a given topic, that's perfectly normal.

Take your time, pause the video, watch the topic again, and try to fully undestand what's going on.

And is not, yout still have the astronomer forum to ask questions.

And you can even reach us if needed.

Okay, so that's it about the introduction of the preparation course.

I hope you're ready.

Fasten your seat belt, take a deep breath, and lets get started.
